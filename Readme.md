### Information
A basic kernel, designed by [Broken-Admin](https://github.com/broken-admin). This is the basis of possibly a future operating system I plan to develop in the future. This is the result of the studying of code of multiple basic microkernels.

It is written in Assembly, assembled with `NASM` and C, compiled with `gcc`. All linked with `ld`.
